# BLACKROCK CASTLE

![Am I Responsive](https://github.com/JosephOConnell/Blackrock-Castle/blob/main/assets/readmeImages/am-i-responsive.png)

This page is based on my local Castle in Co. Cork Ireland.
I have gathered information and put together a brief history of the castle, what the castle is being used for now and the castle cafe the resides in the courtyard.
I have sourced a video, images and reviews to show what to expect from the castle.

### Features

- **Fixed Navigation Bar**

  - Featured on both pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to Home, Location, Reviews, Contact and Gallery and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the "back" button.

- **The hero page**

  - The Hero includes a hero image with text overlay.
  - I took the idea for the overlay from the love running project as it adds that little bit extra.

I recommend using WAVE as well to check your pages
"expand more on deployment steps (cloning repo, launching in IDE, git add/commit/push to github)"
all pages must pass through lighthouse
