# BLACKROCK CASTLE

In this section, you will include one or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Essentially, this part is your sales pitch. At this stage, you should have a name for your project so use it! Don’t introduce the project as a Portfolio project for the diploma. In this section, describe what the project hopes to accomplish, who it is intended to target and how it will be useful to the target audience.

This page is based on my local Castle in Co. Cork Ireland.
I have gathered information and put together a brief history of the castle and what it is being used for now.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### Existing Features

- **Fixed Navigation Bar**

  - Featured on both pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to Home, Location, Reviews, Contact and Gallery and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

- **The hero page**

  - The Hero includes a photograph with text overlay.
  - I took the idea for the overlay from the love running project as it adds that little bit extra.

  - The history page will give the user all the basic history of the castl.

  - I used formspree as the backend for this.

- **Gallery**
  - The gallery will provide the user with supporting images to see what the the castle look like foom many different angles.

### Features I would like to Implement

- Flexbox: I spent most of my time trying to get the responsiveness of my page right. I think with a bit more knowledge of flexbox this could have been easier.
- Hamburger Menu: Again using Overflow and Float made keeping the Nav Bar clean a problem. A hamburger menu would have gotten rid of this for smaller screens.

## Testing NOT DONE YET

- I had a big problem withe the media queries. I had most of the pages widths done in PX instead of %. When I corrected that I restarted the media queries. I got most sizes done well but I could easily put another day into getting every size perfect.
- Made a silly mistake and forgot to link the index.css to the gallery.
- Forgot to add font size to nav-title
- Left a space in the mailto which through an error in W3 Validation.
- I had Duplicate ID's for nav-list and href. (25 errors returned when passing through the official W3C validator. There were all for Duplicate ID's)
- I need to remove a value of (relative) on line 82.

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
