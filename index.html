            <h2>
                A Brief History
            </h2>
            <p>
                Although formal records do not begin until about the middle of the 16th century, there are indications
                that
                a
                fortification of one type or another has stood on the tiny promontory jutting out into Cork Harbour
                since
                Anglo-Norman
                times. In the late 16th century, the citizens of Cork appealed to Queen Elizabeth I to construct a fort
                at
                Blackrock to
                "repel pirates and other invaders".
                Blackrock Castle was originally built on the Lee in 1582 by the citizens of Cork as a watch tower and
                fort
                to
                guard the
                river entrance against pirates and other invaders. In 1600 a round tower was constructed by the
                Elizabethan
                government
                at the request of the citizens of Cork to protect them from marauding pirates and other invaders.
                Following
                a
                charter by
                James I in 1608, Blackrock Castle was handed over to the City of Cork.
                In 1722 the old four-storey tower was destroyed by fire and new one was rebuilt with an octagonal room
                topped
                with a
                cupola.
                Throughout this period, the castle was used by Cork Corporation for banquets and "convivial gatherings"
                -
                some
                associated with the custom of "throwing the dart". This custom, dating to at least the 18th century, was
                held
                every
                three years in August, and involved a dart (an arrow about four feet long) being thrown by the Mayor
                from a
                boat, to
                indicate the Corporation's jurisdiction over the harbour.
                On a freezing night in 1827, the iconic Blackrock Castle went up in smoke. PAT POLAND recalls the
                inferno,
                and
                the 190th
                anniversary of its grand reopening Old Blackrock Castle, with majestic height Salutes by day, and guides
                our
                boat by
                night. SO wrote local poet and lawyer Henry Bennett, alluding to the lantern on the castle that served
                as a
                beacon of
                comfort to the fishermen abroad on Lough Mahon in the darkness of night. Shortly after he penned those
                lines,
                however,
                it wasn't the beam from the lighthouse that lit up the surrounding area, but the castle itself. For
                early on
                the
                morning
                of Tuesday, February 27, 1827, Blackrock Castle burned to the ground in a spectacular blaze.
                The rebuilding began at the direction of Mayor Thomas Dunscombe in 1828 and was completed in March 1829.
                The
                architects
                added three additional storeys to the original tower and rebuilt the out-buildings. The new building
                cost
                the
                City of
                Cork £1,000. The architects were George Richard Pain and James Pain, who were responsible for other
                public
                buildings
                around Cork at the time. The neo-gothic complex of buildings around a courtyard is essentially what
                remains
                today.
                The present castle consists of a large circular tower with crenellated parapets resting on large
                corbels. It
                incorporates portions of the walls of the second castle which were strong enough to withstand the impact
                of
                cannon
                balls. On its eastern side it is joined to a cylindrical tower rising several feet above the main
                structure.
                At
                the side
                of this tower is a watergate leading to a slipway. Blackrock Castle was used by Cork Corporation for
                civic
                functions
                during the nineteenth century. The castle was in private hands for many years but is now restored and
                used
                as an
                observatory, operated by staff from the Cork Institute of Technology, it is open to the public and has a
                restaurant
                onsite.

                Blackrock Castle Observatory
            </h2>
            <p>
                In the early-2000s, Blackrock Castle was redeveloped under a joint venture between Cork City Council,
                Cork
                Institute of Technology
                and a private benefactor as a science center and observatory.
                The center features interactive exhibits exploring topics such as space, astronomy, and marine biology.
                The castle's tower now houses a state-of-the-art observatory, which offers visitors the chance to
                stargaze
                and
                learn about the wonders of the universe.
                One of the most popular attractions at Blackrock Castle is thethe "Cosmos at the Castle".
                This project was intended to create a "centre for scientific research, outreach and communication".
                This immersive show takes visitors on a journey through space and time,
                exploring the history of the universe and our place in it. The show features stunning visuals and is a
                must-see
                for anyone interested in astronomy.
                The castle's observatory houses an interactive astronomy center which is open to the public, and has
                exhibits
                including a
                "tour of the universe" and a radio telescope that beams messages composed by school groups towards
                nearby
                stars.
                The castle also houses labs staffed by astronomical researchers from Cork Institute of Technology.
