# BLACKROCK CASTLE

In this section, you will include one or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Essentially, this part is your sales pitch. At this stage, you should have a name for your project so use it! Don’t introduce the project as a Portfolio project for the diploma. In this section, describe what the project hopes to accomplish, who it is intended to target and how it will be useful to the target audience.

This page is based on my local Castle in Co. Cork Ireland.
I have gathered information and put together a brief history of the castle and what it is being used for now.

### Features

- **Fixed Navigation Bar**

  - Featured on both pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to Home, Location, Reviews, Contact and Gallery and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

- **The hero page**

  - The Hero includes a photograph with text overlay.
  - I took the idea for the overlay from the love running project as it adds that little bit extra.

## Testing

- I had a big problem withe the media queries. I had most of the pages widths done in PX instead of %. When I corrected that I restarted the media queries. I got most sizes done well but I could easily put another day into getting every size perfect.
- Made a silly mistake and forgot to link the index.css to the gallery.
- Forgot to add font size to nav-title
- Left a space in the mailto which through an error in W3 Validation.
- I had Duplicate ID's for nav-list and href. (25 errors returned when passing through the official W3C validator. There were all for Duplicate ID's)
- I need to remove a value of (relative) on line 82.

- Tested the responsiveness of my site on [Am I Responsive?] (<https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://josephoconnell.github.io/Blackrock-Castle/>)
