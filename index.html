                <h1>
                    A Brief History
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Although formal records do not begin until about the middle of the 16th century, there are
                    indications
                    that
                    a
                    fortification of one type or another has stood on the tiny promontory jutting out into Cork Harbour
                    since
                    Anglo-Norman
                    times. In the late 16th century, the citizens of Cork appealed to Queen Elizabeth I to construct a
                    fort
                    at
                    Blackrock to
                    "repel pirates and other invaders".
                    Blackrock Castle was originally built on the Lee in 1582 by the citizens of Cork as a watch tower
                    and
                    fort
                    to
                    guard the
                    river entrance against pirates and other invaders. In 1600 a round tower was constructed by the
                    Elizabethan
                    government
                    at the request of the citizens of Cork to protect them from marauding pirates and other invaders.
                    Following
                    a
                    charter by
                    James I in 1608, Blackrock Castle was handed over to the City of Cork.
                    In 1722 the old four-storey tower was destroyed by fire and new one was rebuilt with an octagonal
                    room
                    topped
                    with a
                    cupola.
                    Throughout this period, the castle was used by Cork Corporation for banquets and "convivial
                    gatherings"
                    -
                    some
                    associated with the custom of "throwing the dart". This custom, dating to at least the 18th century,
                    was
                    held
                    every
                    three years in August, and involved a dart (an arrow about four feet long) being thrown by the Mayor
                    from a
                    boat, to
                    indicate the Corporation's jurisdiction over the harbour.
                    On a freezing night in 1827, the iconic Blackrock Castle went up in smoke. PAT POLAND recalls the
                    inferno,
                    and
                    the 190th
                    anniversary of its grand reopening Old Blackrock Castle, with majestic height Salutes by day, and
                    guides
                    our
                    boat by
                    night. SO wrote local poet and lawyer Henry Bennett, alluding to the lantern on the castle that
                    served
                    as a
                    beacon of
                    comfort to the fishermen abroad on Lough Mahon in the darkness of night. Shortly after he penned
                    those
                    lines,
                    however,
                    it wasn't the beam from the lighthouse that lit up the surrounding area, but the castle itself. For
                    early on
                    the
                    morning
                    of Tuesday, February 27, 1827, Blackrock Castle burned to the ground in a spectacular blaze.
                    The rebuilding began at the direction of Mayor Thomas Dunscombe in 1828 and was completed in March
                    1829.
                    The
                    architects
                    added three additional storeys to the original tower and rebuilt the out-buildings. The new building
                    cost
                    the
                    City of
                    Cork Â£1,000. The architects were George Richard Pain and James Pain, who were responsible for other
                    public
                    buildings
                    around Cork at the time. The neo-gothic complex of buildings around a courtyard is essentially what
                    remains
                    today.
                    The present castle consists of a large circular tower with crenellated parapets resting on large
                    corbels. It
                    incorporates portions of the walls of the second castle which were strong enough to withstand the
                    impact
                    of
                    cannon
                    balls. On its eastern side it is joined to a cylindrical tower rising several feet above the main
                    structure.
                    At
                    the side
                    of this tower is a watergate leading to a slipway. Blackrock Castle was used by Cork Corporation for
                    civic
                    functions
                    during the nineteenth century. The castle was in private hands for many years but is now restored
                    and
                    used
                    as an
                    observatory, operated by staff from the Cork Institute of Technology, it is open to the public and
                    has a
                    restaurant
                    onsite.

                </h1>
                <p>
                    In the early-2000s, Blackrock Castle was redeveloped under a joint venture between Cork City
                    Council,
                    Cork
                    Institute of Technology
                    and a private benefactor as a science center and observatory.
                    The center features interactive exhibits exploring topics such as space, astronomy, and marine
                    biology.
                    The castle's tower now houses a state-of-the-art observatory, which offers visitors the chance to
                    stargaze
                    and
                    learn about the wonders of the universe.
                    One of the most popular attractions at Blackrock Castle is thethe "Cosmos at the Castle".
                    This project was intended to create a "centre for scientific research, outreach and communication".
                    This immersive show takes visitors on a journey through space and time,
                    exploring the history of the universe and our place in it. The show features stunning visuals and is
                    a
                    must-see
                    for anyone interested in astronomy.
                    The castle's observatory houses an interactive astronomy center which is open to the public, and has
                    exhibits
                    including a
                    "tour of the universe" and a radio telescope that beams messages composed by school groups towards
                    nearby
                    stars.
                    The castle also houses labs staffed by astronomical researchers from Cork Institute of Technology.
